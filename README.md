# Doors95

Doors95 is an interactive browser game build to teach users about dangers they can encounter while doing (daily) tasks on a computer. 
You are placed onto a simulated computer desktop inspired by Windows 95 and are guided through the different missions by our AI assistant Skippy. The main objective is to complete the task at hand without getting infected with viruses.

The project is hosted and you can try it out here: https://doors95.netlify.app/
